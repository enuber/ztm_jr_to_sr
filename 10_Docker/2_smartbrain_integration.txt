Need to start by building an image at the root level. Needs to be called Dockerfile. 

1. Add node
go to docker hub to find the version of node you want to run based on the version you have on your computer. 

Choose the Right Image Version
Node.js images come in various versions and configurations. Hereâ€™s how to choose:

Tags: Each image version is identified by a tag. Common tags include:

node:latest - The latest stable version of Node.js.
node:<version> - A specific version, like node:18 or node:16.
node:<version>-alpine - A smaller, lightweight version based on the Alpine Linux distribution.
node:<version>-slim - A slimmer version with fewer dependencies, making the image smaller in size.

LTS vs. Current:
LTS (Long-Term Support) versions are stable and receive maintenance updates for a longer period.
Current versions include the latest features but are updated more frequently and might not be as stable.

Alpine vs. Debian:
Alpine images are smaller and faster but might have compatibility issues with some Node.js packages.
Debian-based images (slim, buster, bullseye, etc.) are larger but more compatible.

In the command docker run -it ny-node-app, the -it flag is actually a combination of two separate flags, -i and -t. Here's what they stand for:

-i (Interactive mode):
This flag keeps the STDIN (Standard Input) open, even if you're not attached to the container. It allows you to interact with the container in real-time, which is useful if you need to run commands within the container.

-t (Pseudo-TTY or Terminal mode):
This flag allocates a pseudo-TTY (a terminal), which allows you to have a text-based interface. This is useful for running a container that requires a terminal session, such as when you're using a command-line interface (CLI) inside the container.
When combined as -it, it allows you to run a container in an interactive terminal session, which is useful for tasks like debugging, running bash, or executing commands within the container.
