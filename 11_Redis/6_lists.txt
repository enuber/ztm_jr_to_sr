Redis Lists are a versatile data structure that stores an ordered sequence of strings. They can be used for various use cases, such as implementing queues, stacks, or simply storing sequences of items in order.

Basic Operations with Lists

Appending an Element to the List

RPUSH key value [value ...]: Adds one or more elements to the end (right) of the list.

RPUSH mylist "Hello"
RPUSH mylist "World"


Prepending an Element to the List

LPUSH key value [value ...]: Adds one or more elements to the start (left) of the list.

LPUSH mylist "First"


Retrieving Elements from the List

LRANGE key start stop: Retrieves a range of elements from the list, where start and stop are zero-based indices. Use -1 to specify the end of the list.

LRANGE mylist 0 -1
This command returns all elements in the list from start to stop.


Popping an Element from the List

RPOP key: Removes and returns the last element of the list.

RPOP mylist
LPOP key: Removes and returns the first element of the list.

LPOP mylist


Getting the Length of the List

LLEN key: Returns the length (number of elements) of the list.

LLEN mylist


Getting an Element by Index

LINDEX key index: Returns the element at the specified index in the list.
LINDEX mylist 0


Inserting an Element Before or After Another Element

LINSERT key BEFORE|AFTER pivot value: Inserts an element before or after the specified pivot element in the list.

LINSERT mylist BEFORE "World" "Redis"


Setting the Value of an Element by Index

LSET key index value: Sets the list element at the specified index to a new value.
LSET mylist 1 "Redis"


Trimming the List

LTRIM key start stop: Trims the list to only include elements between the start and stop indices.
LTRIM mylist 1 -1


Removing Elements from the List

LREM key count value: Removes the first count occurrences of value from the list. If count is positive, it removes from the head to the tail; if negative, from the tail to the head; if zero, all occurrences are removed.

LREM mylist 2 "Hello"


Example Usage
Let's say you want to create a simple to-do list where tasks are added in the order they come:

RPUSH todo "Buy groceries"
RPUSH todo "Clean the house"
RPUSH todo "Finish the project"


To view the tasks:

LRANGE todo 0 -1

This might return:

1) "Buy groceries"
2) "Clean the house"
3) "Finish the project"

To mark the first task as done and remove it from the list:


LPOP todo


Use Cases
Message Queues: Redis Lists can be used to implement FIFO (First In, First Out) queues, where messages are added to the end of the list and processed by removing them from the start.
Stacks: Implement a stack (LIFO - Last In, First Out) by using LPUSH to add and LPOP to remove.
Activity Feeds: Store and retrieve user activity logs in chronological order.
Job Queues: Queue jobs to be processed in the order they were added.

Redis Lists are highly efficient for adding, removing, and accessing elements, making them suitable for a wide range of real-time applications.
