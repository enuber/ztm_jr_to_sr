JWT = jason web tokens

sessions = allows you to have an app where people remain signed in


Cookies vs tokens

1. Authentication
JWTs are frequently used in authentication systems. After a user logs in, the server generates a token and sends it to the client, which stores it (often in localStorage or cookies). The token is then included in the headers of subsequent requests to authenticate the user.
Single Sign-On (SSO) systems rely heavily on JWTs because they allow authentication information to be transmitted securely across different domains or applications.

2. Authorization
JWTs are commonly used for authorization purposes. Once the user is authenticated, the token contains claims or permissions indicating what the user is allowed to do within the system.

3. Stateless and Scalable Systems
Since JWTs are self-contained, they enable stateless authentication systems, where the server does not need to store session information. This helps in scaling applications horizontally, especially in distributed systems and microservice architectures.

4. Mobile and Single Page Applications (SPA)
In mobile applications and SPAs, JWTs are frequently used because they enable token-based authentication, which can be more efficient and flexible than traditional session-based authentication.

5. Decentralized Identity
JWTs play a significant role in decentralized identity systems where they are used to prove identity and carry identity-related information across platforms in a secure manner.


Why JWTs are Still Used:
Compact and Lightweight: JWTs are lightweight and can be easily passed around in HTTP headers, URLs, or even inside HTML5 web storage.
Self-contained: JWTs contain all the necessary information (claims), so servers don't need to store session information, making the system stateless.
Easy to Verify: The server can easily verify the token's signature to ensure its authenticity and integrity.
Cross-domain Support: Since JWTs are not bound to a specific protocol, they work well across different platforms and domains, making them ideal for distributed applications.


Alternatives and Considerations
While JWTs are still popular, there are alternatives like OAuth 2.0 (which often uses JWT under the hood) or session-based authentication. However, JWTs have some limitations:

Security Risks: Storing JWTs in client-side storage (like localStorage) can expose them to certain attacks (e.g., XSS). Storing them in secure, HttpOnly cookies is often recommended.
Revocation: JWTs are typically stateless, making them harder to revoke once issued. Systems often have to implement a blacklist or token expiration to mitigate this.


Conclusion
JWTs are still highly relevant and used across various applications, especially for stateless authentication, API security, and cross-platform identity management. Despite some security considerations, they remain a popular and efficient tool in modern web development.
