// SSH - secure shell is a protocol. Way to contect two computers and have a shared agreement on how to communicate. SSH is a way for machines to communicate with one another.

// HTTP - allows you to share send files over the internet bewteen browsers and servers
// FTP - allows you to transfer files as well often used to upload files from your computer
// HTTPS - similar to HTTP but is encrypted. It is "secure"

// SSH - a shell needs a certain protocol to enable data exchange, it is also encrypted, between two devices not just a browser and a server. It is used over a shell. Talk to the operating system. You use the terminal to talk to another computer.

// advantage of ssh is use of encryption between the host and the client. The host is the remote computer you are trying to acces and the client is your computer.

// to do it, it is very simple to do in the terminal

// ssh - key command instructs your system you want to open ane encrypted secure shell connection
// user - represents the account you want to access.
// host - refers to the computer to access, like an IP address or a domain name

// ssh {user}@{host}

// here root is used as the user, which may be a default in some cases and the IP address is the address for the host.
// ex:  ssh root@167.99.146.57

// when you do this, you will likely see something that changes your terminal to start with..

// ex: root@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc1-01:~#

// this would replace your own location as you are now inside that other computer.

// as with all terminals, same commands still work. (ls - list what ist here.)
