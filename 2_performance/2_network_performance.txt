Network Performance

We must send a request to a server to get a website. Often many requests happen to load one page of a site.

Minimize files - the more kb need to download the longer it takes to load. 

How?
minimize the text files, HTML CSS JS, and minimize the images. To minimize the text files you can use uglify.js, (webpack has stuff that does this as well).

for images should use file type that goes with what you are using. 
jpg - used for photos and images with many colors. no transparency. bigger in file size

gif - can be grainy and limited in color, reducing the color count reduces file size.

png - limit number of colors, smaller in file size. Good for logos and transparency.

svg - vector graphics. can be used to expand well beyond size because of how they are built. Very good for sharpness. But very simplistic. 

The above are all not as good as jpeg 2000 and webp. 

sites to use for reducing file size
PNG - Tinypng
JPG - JPEG-optimizer


Minimize delivery - 

reducing the number of components that need to be requested and delivered.
