to work with PWA and put the site up on Github pages you can

1 install a helper tool in a react programmable

npm i gh-pages

in the package.json file

2 create new scripts for predeploy and deploy

predeploy gets run before deploy does so you can just do the 

npm run deploy 

and both will run.


3 add a "homepage" to package.json

"homepage" : "https://enuber.github.io/reponame",


4 run the deploy
npm run deploy


5 go to github in the settings for the repo scroll down to github pages and make sure that the branch selected is on gh-pages branch.
