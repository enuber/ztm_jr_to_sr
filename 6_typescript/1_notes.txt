Typscript

static type checking. Makes JS which is a dynamically typed language a static based language.

Dynamic vs Static typing

In a static language you have to define what the type of the variable before using them.

Dynamically typed languages aren't bound to a specific type. Can define and use at the same time and, JS assigns what type it is during runtime


Strong vs weak typing

JS is a weakly type language. It allows you to for example add a string and number where there is type coercion. 

Strong type langauge you can't add a string to a number.


Static Typing in JS

TS is a superset of JS. TS just adds a few features on top of JS and, it runs through a TS compiler to give us JS.
