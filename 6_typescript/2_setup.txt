installs the compiler globally, will also update to latest version

npm install -g typescript

version 
tsc -v


a typscript file just needs to end with .ts 

create simple ts file and then run to compile it, will spit out a .jsz
tsc <filename.ts> 

so you don't have to type the tsc filename all the time you can do 

tsc --init

this will give you a tsconfig.json file, you can make changes to it and, there is doc on the file on the ts website


beyond this, to actually watch a specfic file to do the outputing

tsc <filename.ts> --watch
