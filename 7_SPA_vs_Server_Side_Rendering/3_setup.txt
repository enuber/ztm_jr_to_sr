npx create-next-app@latest

or

mkdir directoryname
cd directoryname
npm init -y
npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest

in package.json

{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint"
  }
}

then 
npm run dev

need to have an app folder

inside of it by making new folders it creates routes

ex: 

app/
├── about/
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   └── page.tsx
└── layout.tsx
└── page.tsx

if you make a page.js or .tsx file it will auto create the layout file

Notes:

in the app layout, you can define the layout with a head, footer and the body is where the children go. When you code in page.js/tsx that is what will be shown as the child. No need to import react etc as it's all covered behind the scenes. Just has to be exported.

______________________________
dynamic apps with next.js

can use fetch as you normally would.
