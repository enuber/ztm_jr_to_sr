encrypt data in transition. Selective of what data is being encrypted like phone, email,

bcrypt, scrypt, Aragon2 - hashing passwords (Note aragon2 is the preferred today)

pgcrypto - encrypt a few columns


Here's an example of how to use bcrypt for hashing and comparing passwords in a Node.js application:

Step 1: Install bcrypt
First, you need to install the bcrypt package:

npm install bcrypt

Step 2: Hashing a Password
To securely store a password, you hash it using bcrypt. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

// The number of salt rounds. Higher values are more secure but slower.
const saltRounds = 10;

// The password to be hashed
const plainTextPassword = 'mySecurePassword';

// Hash the password
bcrypt.hash(plainTextPassword, saltRounds, (err, hash) => {
    if (err) {
        console.error('Error hashing password:', err);
        return;
    }
    console.log('Hashed password:', hash);
});

Step 3: Comparing a Password
When a user tries to log in, you compare the hashed password stored in the database with the plaintext password they provided:

const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

const plainTextPassword = 'mySecurePassword';
const storedHashedPassword = '$2b$10$W.qkN0TlWoZgCmWoZcPBLu8hMfgTzRkzDdRkE5N9Vw98KKMc3Sz0O'; // Example hashed password

// Compare the password
bcrypt.compare(plainTextPassword, storedHashedPassword, (err, result) => {
    if (err) {
        console.error('Error comparing passwords:', err);
        return;
    }

    if (result) {
        console.log('Passwords match!');
    } else {
        console.log('Passwords do not match!');
    }
});

Explanation:
Salt Rounds: The saltRounds parameter defines how many rounds of salting should be applied. More rounds make the hashing process slower, which can protect against brute-force attacks.
Hashing: bcrypt.hash takes the plaintext password and the number of salt rounds, and returns a hashed version of the password.
Comparing: bcrypt.compare takes the plaintext password and the hashed password, and returns whether they match.
Asynchronous vs. Synchronous
The examples above are asynchronous, but you can also use synchronous versions (bcrypt.hashSync and bcrypt.compareSync):

// Synchronous hashing
const hash = bcrypt.hashSync(plainTextPassword, saltRounds);
console.log('Hashed password (sync):', hash);

// Synchronous comparison
const isMatch = bcrypt.compareSync(plainTextPassword, storedHashedPassword);
console.log('Passwords match (sync):', isMatch);


Using bcrypt this way helps secure your users' passwords by making it computationally expensive to brute-force them.
