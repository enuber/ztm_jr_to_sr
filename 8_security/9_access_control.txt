CORS - Cross Origin Resource Sharing

I don't have access for you to access the server is what it is saying


If you set to allow CORS you are saying it's okay to have access. Need to give access only to those you trust.

// can whitelist who can acccess
var whitelist = ['http://example1.com', 'http://example2.com']
var corsOptions = {
  origin: function (origin, callback) {
    if (whitelist.indexOf(origin) !== -1) {
      callback(null, true)
    } else {
      callback(new Error('Not allowed by CORS'))
    }
  }
}

app.use(cors(corsOptions));
